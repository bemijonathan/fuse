Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: Fuse – Interoperable Health Workflow Orchestrator
Version: August 30, 2025 (Post-Working Session PRD)
Vision
Fuse enables healthcare organizations (hospitals, startups, agents) to integrate, automate, and orchestrate complex cross-platform workflows across EHRs, CRMs, and health IT systems using natural language, low-code builders, or embeddable interfaces — all while ensuring HIPAA-grade auditability and observability.
MVP Scope – Proof of Concept
Objective:
Demonstrate a deterministic, multi-step, cross-platform healthcare automation via a workflow builder and MCP architecture.
Success Criteria:
5-step deterministic workflow execution


Cross-platform: at least 2 simulated clinics (e.g., fertility & antenatal)


Real-time audit and observability


Human-in-the-loop verification path


End-to-end event-driven pipeline via MCP
Epics Overview
Epic 1: Natural Language Agent Console
Persona: Clinician / AI Assistant Developer
Goal: Let users describe workflows in plain language and have AI generate structured plans.


Features:


NLP input interface


Agent Planner generates Plan JSON


Dry Run validation mode (tool & input preview)


Plan approval before execution


Acceptance Criteria:


AI can create at least 3-step plans


Plan JSON aligns with MCP tool manifest schema


Users can edit before approving
Epic 2: Visual Workflow Builder
Persona: Admins / Ops Managers / Developer Advocate
Goal: Drag-and-drop interface for composing workflows using triggers, tools, and conditions.


Features:


Node canvas UI (trigger → actions)


Connector block (e.g., Slack, Epic, Email, CRM)


Conditions, retries, timeouts


Embeddable iframe option for clinics


Acceptance Criteria:


Build & test a 5-step workflow (trigger → action → result)


Hospital IT team can embed builder on EHR intranet
Epic 3: MCP (Modular Connector Protocol) Runtime
Persona: Platform Architect / Agent Devs / Integrators
Goal: Enable deterministic tool invocation via manifests, schemas, and hashed secrets.


Features:


Manifest registry (YAML/JSON)


Tool schema definitions (input/output)


API key/OAuth/secret store vault


Event triggers & audit logs


Acceptance Criteria:


Add support for at least 3 MCP manifests (e.g., EHR, Slack, Labs)


MCP server resolves toolchain with context + input mapping
Epic 4: Observability & Audit Trail
Persona: Compliance Officer / Infra Lead / CTO
Goal: Provide secure, WORM-logged, redacted audit trails with event lineage.


Features:


workflow.run.* events


Shared logs + trace per patient


Break-glass & PHI redaction model


On-premise / self-hosted cluster deployment support


Acceptance Criteria:


Can trace any request/response step to the tool and user that triggered it


Support hash-verified audit export
Epic 5: Integration & Partner Ecosystem
Persona: AI Agent Startup / EHR Vendor / Digital Health App
Goal: Allow third parties to integrate MCP manifests or workflows via exposed APIs or embeds.


Features:


Developer Portal + API key issuing


Tool manifest uploader with test harness


Embed builder into other platforms via iframe + secrets


Acceptance Criteria:


AI fertility clinic can expose booking tool


EHR startup can integrate Fuse workflows via API key + context
Epic 6: Onboarding & Access Management
Persona: Admin / Ops Lead / IT Support
Goal: Simplify self-serve onboarding, role setup, and workflow import


Features:


Waitlist and org creation form


Slack/Email/Google Sign-in


Patient/thread import from CSV


API vault + permissions config


Acceptance Criteria:


Org can onboard in < 10 min


Connect 2 tools and execute a dry-run workflow within 30 minutes
